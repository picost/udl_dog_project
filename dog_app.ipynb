If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). \n",

    "\n",
    "I choose to let torchvision resize the images for me using the `torchvision.Resize` transformation which streches the pictures using a bilinear transformation according to the [doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.Resize). The final image size was chosen directly to fit the input shape of the network to be trained. In the present case, it was chosen to feed the network with 80x80 pictures. This was a compromise between:\n",
    "- conserving enough of the original image information to enable the network to discriminate between dogs breed\n",
    "- lowering the number of features and parameters in the network to minimize the training cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the chosen three-convolutional-layer architecture, the number of description feature in each channel is divided by 4 at each of the convolution step while the number of channel is increased by a factor 2 (except in the first one from 3 to 16). After the convolution, the remaining number of features is with an 80x80x3 input image 6400 which gives a reasonable number of parameters ($\\approx 3.10^7$) to be fitted (with dropout) in the linear layers, which contain by far the highest number of hyper-parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the targeted accuracy for this part of the assignment is reasonably small (10%), the chosen resolution seemed a good compromise. This choice is therfore quiet arbitrary, the only constraint comming form the network beeing that the number of pixels in each dimension must be a multiple of 8 as.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, all the pictures were resized to 120% of the desired final size, which let enough room to apply the augmentation procedure which consisted in :\n",
    "- rotating randomly the picture with a 30° amplitude\n",
    "- flipping randomly the picture horizontally\n",
    "- randomly cropping the picture at the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical flip was not applied as it seamed a reasonable assumption in the present case that no dog pictures would be upside-down. As convolutional neural networks are not rotation-invariant, accounting for this case would maybe have required a more complex network (although I admit that I did not perform the comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common practice is to use TenCrops but as our dataset looks to contain subjects that occupy most of the  picture, random crops seemed relevant as well."

    "\n",
    "Initially, I had no clue about how to chose a starting point among the models available in torchvision. I took a look at the available models, their accuracies and structures as well as the main idea that lead to tadopt them. Finally, I decided to give a try with a model:\n",
    "1. which last layers were dense linear ones \n",
    "2. with a small numbrer of parameters to be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point n.2 looked to be good in the sense that optimization complexity seemed reduced, with the risk of uncertain generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed a first test with MobileNet architecture which was not conclusive. After trying a few other architectures, I realized that my training code was bugged in a very silly way: I did not train the parameters from the right model...\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally used VGG19 as I had some ideas in mind for which knowing the layer to be fitted in order to keep the sementical information from an image could be usefull (see https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf and the style-transfer assignment), as discussed at the end of this assignment. I did not re-try other architectures or numerous optimization starting point as training this network remains a costly task especially when training locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide a relevant initial set of weights for the classifier, I used the fact that the original VGG19 network was already trained to classify some of the dog breeds in our dataset. After identifying which of the original output classes from VGG19 were also present in our dataset, the network classifier was initialized as follows:\n",
    "- the weights and bias for the already existing classes were initializd with their values from original VGG19\n",
    "- the weights and bias for the other classes were initialiazd randomly, with a normal distribution for the weights as tought in the course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this initialization procedure, a 49% validation accuracy is obtained after the first training epoch and around 70% after 10 epoch. In order to check if this procedure was relevant, another model, initialized only from normal distributrion this time, was trained for 10 epoch. This model had a 65% accuracy after the first training epoch and a 70% accuracy after 10 epochs. This leads to the two following conclusions:\n",
    " - 1) The initialization procedure which reused \"trained\" weights for a part of the network was therefore a counter-efficient idea in this case. \n",
    " - 2) The transfer learning approach is very effective for this classification task!\n",
    "\n",
    "Point 2) is not a surprise as VGG19 network was trained to classify images thae contained 118 dog breeds, 78 of which belong to our target classes. \n",
    "The present case is therfore the one of training on similar tasks with a small dataset which is the one for which transfer learning is the best suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to understand properly why this procedure is counter-productive would require a thorough investigation during the optimization process which is not the point of this exercise. However, my assumption regarding point 1) would be that the very different maturity of the weights for different classes can be at the origin of this problem in the following way:\n",
    "- There are 3 fully connected layers in the calssifier.\n",
    "- The first two layers have the original VGG19 weights.\n",
    "- In the last layer, the weights for existing classes are reused (after matching the indices) and those of new classes are randomly initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of  the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a new sample comes for a \"new\" class label, ALL the classifier weigts are changed, including those of the first two layers. This can degrade the accuracy for the previously existing class as the weights were already fitted.\n",
    "- When a new sample comes for an existing class label, the weights in the first two layers are moved \"back\" toward their initial values.\n",
    "This would introduce a kind of competition between the new and pre-existing classes in the choice of the weights, explaining why the accuracy is degraded at the beginning io the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon could be assimilated to the one described in [this paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5347-how-transferable-are-features-in-deep-neural-networks.pdf) about transfer learning. The authors notice that re-training a network while keeping the weights from the first layers can actually degrade accuracy when truncating at the network \"in the middle\", where the weights were \"fragily co-adapted\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in both case, the network produce a decent accuracy, well above 60% in both cases after a few training steps."
